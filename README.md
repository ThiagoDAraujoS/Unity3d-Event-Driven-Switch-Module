# Unity3d Event Driven Switch System
### About
#### Description
This repository contains a generic binary event system to help with level design. They can be used to define level design elements such as  switches, buttons, floating platforms, doors, lights and cutscenes.

#### Development
This repository is being developed as a sub module of [Project Byzantium](https://github.com/ThiagoDAraujoS/Unity3d-Project-Byzantium-702963), as Byzantium requires this module's elements to be created, they will be implemented as such.
